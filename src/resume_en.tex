\section*{Work Experience}
\textbf{RT Information Security --- Machine Learning Engineer}\hfill \textit{December 2024 --- present}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed an automated classification system for false positive alerts in information security events with rule-based filtering
  \item Developed an automated rule generation system for filtering information security incidents using LLM and regular expressions
  \item Refactored the automated incident correlation system for information security: redesigned monolith into modular architecture with independent components
  \item Developed a monitoring and anomaly detection system for information security events and incidents: identifying drops, short-term spikes, and long-term trends
  \item Developed internal libraries for building ML data processing pipelines and constructing ensembles from modules with different training cycles
  \item Developed an ETL system for automated collection and normalization of data from non-standardized JSON sources
  \item Implemented CI/CD for ML services: unified deployment format and automated application deployment
  \item Implemented code quality standards: linters, static analyzers, docstrings for unified development style across the team
  \item Standardized DAG development in Airflow for ML pipelines
  \item Implemented MinIO for versioning datasets and model artifacts
